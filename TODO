mute: que pasa?

TEST:
swap
cache

test algo
test beaglebone
shutdown stuff
transport: recv buffer and send vector
backoff threshold way too big

how does leader leave
problem: empty frequencies?
can we swap up into them?

election: dont become leader when current leader is swapping
react on do migrate?

radio: asynchronous listen?

backoff: transfer mode asynchronous? -> backoff broken

endlosschleife? start node, goto 801, repeat 4 times
hashmap bug fixed
might still occur??

swap down: node joins and goes to child to trigger swap from parent, node tries to register and catches old leaders swap request, node thinks it lost election
solution: when node leaves down, leader must wait before attempting the swap

swap problem: with empty parent frequencies we may end up with big detached subtrees
solution: if on swapping up nobody answers, we split towards the parent

split up why do 2 go away with 3 nodes

leader leaving solution:
already present nodes just start a new election
problem: node registered but currently searching (shhhh)

can leader searchfor?
