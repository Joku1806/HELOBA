mute: que pasa?

TEST:
swap

test beaglebone
shutdown stuff
transport: recv buffer and send vector

LEADER SOLVED
leader leaving solution:
already present nodes just start a new election
problem: node registered but currently searching
no problem, next node coming becomes leader

BEAGLEBONE PROBLEMS
leader in midst of operation, other node sends message, message lost -> long enough preamble fixes it


SWAP PROBLEMS


SWAP SOLVED
swap problem: with empty parent frequencies we may end up with big detached subtrees
solution: if on swapping up nobody answers, we split towards the parent
like this we also distribute our load upwards and it eventually meets up with the top 
(currently disabled)

we readjusted swap logic to try to swap based on timeout

RADIO 

try to shorten preamble such that sending operation does not last as long
try to reduce timeouts

adjust backoff timeout accordingly

Problem: sometimes the registration message is not received by the leader / CRC is broken

thought its bc of short timeout but seems independent
tried to reduce RSSI threshold, let's see if that works
